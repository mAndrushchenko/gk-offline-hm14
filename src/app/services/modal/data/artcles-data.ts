    description: 'No matter where you go, it\'s comforting to know you can always enjoy a Coca-Cola. Well, almost anywhere. While this fizzy drink is sold practically everywhere, it still hasn\'t (officially) made its way to North Korea or Cuba, according to the BBC. That\'s because these countries are under long-term U.S. trade embargoes.\n\nHowever, some folks say you might be able to snag a sip of the stuff if you try hard enough (although it\'ll typically be a lot more expensive than what you would pay in the states—and probably imported from a neighboring country such as Mexico or China).'

    description: 'The world\'s total population is more than 7.5 billion. And obviously, that number sounds huge. However, it might feel a little more manageable once you learn that if every single one of those people stood shoulder-to-shoulder, they could all fit within the 500 square miles of Los Angeles, according to National Geographic.'

    description: 'You might think twins are a rarity, but they\'re actually becoming more common than ever. "From about 1915, when the statistical record begins, until 1980, about one in every 50 babies born was a twin, a rate of 2 percent," writes Alexis C. Madrigal of The Atlantic. "Then, the rate began to increase: by 1995, it was 2.5 percent. The rate surpassed 3 percent in 2001 and hit 3.3 percent in 2010. [That means] one out of every 30 babies born is a twin."\n' +
      '\n' +
      'Scientists believe this trend is due to the fact that older women tend to have more twins, and women are choosing to start families later. Fertility treatments such as in-vitro fertilization likely also play a role.'

      '\n' +
      '"I\'ve tried it on the tip of my tongue and it just burned and burned," said Mike Smith, the hobby grower who invented the Dragon\'s Breath along with scientists from Nottingham University. So why make such an impractical pepper? As it turns out, the chili was initially developed to be used in medical treatment as an anesthetic that can numb the skin.'

    description: 'It might seem safe to assume that the Canary Islands were named after canary birds, but the location was actually named after dogs. Although it\'s off the coast of northwestern Africa, the archipelago is actually part of Spain. In Spanish, the area’s name is Islas Canarias, which comes from the Latin phrase Canariae Insulae for “island of dogs.” World facts related to dogs? Now those we can get behind!'

And while it may not be worth quite as much as jewels and gold to most people, it certainly was the primary goal for those who built the quietest room in the world. Located at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington, the lab room measures a background noise of -20.35 dBA, which is 20 decibels below the threshold of human hearing and breaks previous records for spaces that were deemed the planet’s quietest places, according to CNN.'

Do a little math and you’ll find out that means there are approximately 250 births each minute, 15,000 each hour, and 360,000 each day.

The temperature was recorded in Antarctica during a span of research between 2004 and 2016. Just a few breaths of air at that temperature would induce hemorrhaging in your lungs and kill you.'

      'The recovery is thanks in large part to the Montreal Protocol of 1987, which put a global ban on the use of one of the main culprits for the damage: chlorofluorocarbons (CFOs). Previously, CFOs had been common in refrigerators, aerosol cans, and dry-cleaning chemicals.'
